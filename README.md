# Powerzeesh

This is a Powerline based zsh theme. It aims for simplicity, showing information only when it's relevant, speed and look.

NOTE: powerzeesh_server is not done yet, I want it to look something else same features but without the powerline bars.

## Features

- GIT
- Virtual_env
- Vagrant for virtualbox
- Show error code
- Aware of root
- nodejs version when working in nodejs directory
